There is information available about the organizational structure in a separate file that includes details about report to realtionships between the nodes. We will extract the information about key nodes in the Network and calculate various metrics to explore the relationship within managers and non-managers. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will read in the data and merge it with the reporting information data stored in separate file. We will see what connections insights can be extracted from these email interactions and see what we can determine from calculating various centrality measures. We can calculate betweenness centrality to determine how complex the interaction structure of this organization is. We will hypothesize that comparing Degree Centrality will allow us to identify the most well-connected employees in the company and determine how hierarchial levels of the organization impact internal communication.
